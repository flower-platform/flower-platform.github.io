My plays insist that we should not forget or toss away our history.","As the time goes by, you change, your learn new things, your attitude is different. For the moment, I'm still enjoying ski racing so much that it would be difficult for me to think about ending my career.","My attitude on skis is different now. I have learned to put less pressure on myself and on the edges of my skis when I'm racing, to be keep myself more under control.","Our attitude is that we want to cross over. You can't go on making records just for your own hometown.","I do not share the half-in, half-out attitude to the EU of some in Britain. Britain's place is in Europe.","I think that the U.S. does have this very much more open attitude, and I admire it very much and I think it's very important to the world.

We became international almost overnight.","As I wrote, I found that Aibileen had some things to say that really weren't in her character. She was older, soft-spoken, and she started showing some attitude.","I like England more than I did when I left. It's become a bit of a better country in the last ten years, in the attitude of it.

It relaxed my attitude to the job my center of focus shifted, which I think is very helpful, because even if you're not a very indulgent actor you spend a lot of time thinking about yourself. I don't think that is particularly healthy.","I always said punk was an attitude. It was never about having a Mohican haircut or wearing a ripped T-shirt. It was all about destruction, and the creative potential within that.","Sid Vicious began the age of participation in which everyone could be the artist.

Music that concentrates on those qualities is, I think, easier achieved by free improvisation between people sharing a common attitude, a common language.","I saw 'Taxi Driver,' and 'Taxi Driver' kind of saved my life.

That's the scene that changed my life by changing my attitude about acting.","I've always been a guy who's pretty supportive, its just my nature, so I came in to the situation with the attitude that I wanted to support Johnny and make it work.","I thought I was going to be killed.

I take each case, each job, as it comes.","What has happened is that to some degree they have taken an attitude where they don't listen to demos of diverse subject matters. They're looking for demos like the record the guy on the left just did.","Here you do have forests, where pigs could be raised by letting them root about in the forests for a good part of the year.

We have understood that bad service is done to the nation by those who are impelling to renounce that past.","But I do think that we approach music, in of itself, with a religious attitude.","I think that generally music should be a positive thing, I like Bob Marley's attitude: he said that his goal in life was to single handedly fight all the evil in the world with nothing but music, and when he went to a place he didn't go to play, he went to conquer.","In 1977, at least, he wished to have people believe that he shared and was proud of an attitude toward women that is not acceptable in a politician. In 2003, all he has said is that he doesn't remember the interview.","You'd like more people to recognise what you do is special. But I take the attitude that the best thing I can do for my sport is to be the best at it.

Which is what I intend to do.","So at a time in which the media give the public everything it wants and desires, maybe art should adopt a much more aggressive attitude towards the public.

If you just be a team player on set you can work so much more often.","What do you mean by faith? Is faith enough for Man? Should he be satisfied with faith alone?
